      <p> After being separated from your twin sibling by an unknown god, the main objective of the game is to find your sibling. 
        Players can travel through different nations of the Teyvat, meet new people who might have an idea of where your sibling is, and complete story quests. 
        In the beginning of the game, you can choose which elemental power you want. The elements are Geo, Electro, Ameno, Dendro, Pyro, Hydro,and Cryo. 
        There are also seven nations for the seven different elements. 
        The nations are Mondstadt(Ameno), Liyue(Geo), Inazuma(Electro), Sumeru(Dendro), Fontaine(Hydro), Natlan(Pyro) and Snezhnaya(Cryo). 
        Players can also build a team of four people, including their character, to fight monsters. To get more characters you will have to make a “wish”. Every month there are characters you can get by using wishes. 
        Characters can be 5 star or 4 star. 5 Star characters are the hardest to get so the more you wish the better chance you will be able to get a 5 star character. 
        There is also a Pity system which means every 10 wishes you will be guaranteed a 4 star character or weapon and every 90 wishes you will get a 5 star weapon or 5 star character.

        Some key characters of the game are the traveler, who is who the player plays as; the archons which are the gods of each nation; and other characters who try to help you find your sibling. The 11 factions are Fatui, Frostmoon Scions, Lightkeepers, Wild Hunt, Hexenzirkel, Knights of Favonius, Voynich Guild, Treasure Hoaders, Snowland Fae, Adventurers’ Guild, and Clink-Clank Krumkake Craftshop. The Fatui are considered the military force of this game and there are eleven executive heads apart from the Fatui. They are considered one of the enemies in this game. The Frostmoon Scions are descendants of the legendary golden realm and reside in the mountains. The Lightkeeps are an organization who are the protectors of Nod-Krai who fight Wild Hunt attacks sent by the Abyss. The Wild Hunt is a group of people who are searching for the fragments of the Three Moons. They need these fragments because their leader will be able to gain his power and return back into his completed form. The Hexenzirkel is an organization of powerful witches. The Knights of Favonius is an organization of knights who protect Mondstadt which is one of the seven nations. The Voynich Guild is a merchant guild who maintains order in Nod-Krai. The Treasure Hoaders are a group of bandits, all of Teyvat and sometimes you will have to fight them. The Snowland Fae is a faction located in Snezhnaya, where only high powering people are allowed. The Adventures’ Guilds is a faction that allows people to hire adventurers with anything they need help with such as getting stolen goods or finding something they lost. Clink-Clank Krumkake Craftshop is a famous machine craft shop where a prodigy used to research. They are known for producing many complex inventions. The different classes in Genshin are DPS, Support, and Healer. DPS characters help deal the most damage to monsters. Support helps support the DPS character by giving them a boost of power or forming a shield with their element. Healer helps heal every character you're using when their health is low.

        <ol>
            <li>When playing the game for the first time, explore maps and unlock the teleport way point so when you need to get to a location faster you can just teleport instead of running. </li>
            <li>Only focus on ascending one character at a time and not trying to level up your whole team at same time because it will take too long. </li>
            <li>Don't spend your primo gems every time there is a new banner, save up and when you see a character you like, you will have enough gems to buy them. </li>
            <li>If you see a character you want on the next banner you should prepare your materials so when you get the character you will be able to level them up quickly.  </li>
            <li>The fastest way to earn primo gems is by completing daily quests and completing achievements. </li>
            <li>Complete the limited events first because they won’t be coming back. </li>
            <li>Keep track of how many wishes you make so you can find out if you're close to using 90 wishes. Ninety wishes is a guaranteed 5 star character/ weapon. </li>
